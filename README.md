# hello-world
newbie
Gonna do some stuff to learn some stuff to know some stuff to apply some stuff to master some stuff, yo...

So this step intorudced me to the magic of creating a branch and update this readme file.  This is how you create a copy of the master, as to not mess that thing up...  NO code yet, just updating and managing this text file...but conceptually it's a big import piece so remember this easy yet powerful step.
